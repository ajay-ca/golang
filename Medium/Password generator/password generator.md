#PASSWORD GENERATOR

**Exercise:**
Create a Golang program which generates a password based on the desired length

Here are the requirements that are needed:

* The user should be able to select the length of the password. Password should be in between 8 to 32 character long.
* The password can contain Uppercase, Lowercase, Special characters and Numbers.
* Password generated should be totally random.
* Depending on the characters used and length, we can also show whether the password is strong or not.
* In the end, ask the program to continue to generate or end generation.

*Psst:* Use can use the randomise functions and other packages for this program.

**Example:**
```go
Enter the desired password length (8-32): 25

Generated password:     (Super Strong)
