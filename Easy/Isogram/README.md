# ISOGRAM

**Exercise:**

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.


**Example:**

The word theory is an isogram because each of the letters occurs only once in the word. 
The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
